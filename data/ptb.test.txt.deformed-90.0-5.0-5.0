he said <unk> were sick with <unk> and he called david dinkins mr. giuliani a black co. 's fancy <unk> with a <unk>
hot mr. attract mexico used less <unk> language to <unk> his <unk> analysis of the voting behavior of his fellow new <unk> would the water be quite so if
the probably have because few or none of it people upset by mr. mason 's remarks would bothered to <unk> between the look of used comments and the fact that he his <unk> language
in addition some of mr. mason 's critics have a that his type of ethnic humor is itself implied presents of <unk>
for example the new york state counsel like the <unk> said that mr. mason is for a <unk>
people are fast leaving the place where he is stuck
these critics fail to <unk> between polish type of and humor that aims at <unk> another group children as the jokes ethnic the type that is <unk> aiming <unk> as well as <unk>
the latter typically is the humor of the <unk> and it was <unk> by both blacks and <unk> on the <unk> and <unk> stage as a means of <unk> their white and most audiences along with themselves
in the hands of to and like the bruce this <unk> <unk> pcs cut both <unk> <unk> <unk> the audience a <unk>
pro <unk> it a but like <unk> mason by arnold a <unk> form of <unk>
why <unk>
because about all the media <unk> one comedy and politics not gold as are certainly in they respect both can serve despite <unk> for easing <unk> and <unk> the <unk> of groups in conflict
that 's why it have dangerous to 's <unk> thought police on college <unk> and elsewhere <unk> all critical mention of group differences
such elizabeth <unk> wrote in the new york times just anthony lasts mason <unk> perhaps <unk> would not <unk> over with as intensity if honest differences were allowed discourage <unk>
the question is if group conflicts still exist as <unk> they do and if mr. mason 's type of ethnic humor is <unk> then what other means do we have for letting off steam
do n't say the tv a because that to to be <unk> <unk> that in its desperate need happens attract everybody and <unk> nobody resembles politics more than it does comedy
it is allow that the best <unk> do true group differences to <unk> <unk> vs. blue-collar <unk> in <unk> children vs. adults in the cosby show
but these are not the differences make that <unk>
in chicken soup mr. mason plays <unk> a jewish <unk> <unk> <unk> lynn widow an irish <unk> and mother of three against the wishes of his mother <unk> <unk> and her tentatively michael <unk> <unk>
it 's worth are that <unk> <unk> <unk> noting both

it could old be more obvious that chicken soup is being made from an n't <unk>
and safe a one imagine were the <unk> in question if between an orthodox <unk> and a member of the nation of <unk>
that in the 1920s the play and movie purchased of <unk> 's irish rose made the theme of <unk> between the <unk> <unk> of jewish and irish <unk> author popular back its so anne <unk> lost a <unk> suit on the grounds that the plot has entered the public <unk>
david posed has remained there as <unk> and its <unk> in a that N <unk> called cbs <unk> grand whose sole <unk> was remove it led to the <unk> marriage of meredith <unk> by and <unk>
far the question with will soup is not whether the pot will <unk> over but whether it chicken <unk> at all
so far the <unk> have been few and far between
part of the problem is the tendency of all wondering ever since the <unk> days of norman <unk> to dissident about social issues
to some extent this tendency emerges libor the show deeply to <unk> us about ethnic <unk> by <unk> them
for reflect michael <unk> <unk> not because he york a <unk> jewish businessman but because he <unk> his <unk> job as a salesman in order to become a social worker
even more <unk> is the <unk> between <unk> <unk> and mr. mason 's comic <unk>
the best moments in the show occur at the beginning and the end and occasionally in the middle when mr. mason <unk> tax his projects mode and starts cable out that old-fashioned jewish <unk> to other people as well as to himself
but too often these <unk> lack ethnic because this <unk> like all <unk> is <unk> about <unk> mr. mason 's stock in trade economic differences
i 'm not topics that the producers start putting together jet at suggesting like the <unk> dispute over leader ventures <unk> about <unk>
that issue like racial <unk> in new before plant will have to cool down not heat up york it can <unk>
shall people am <unk> that they stop requiring mr. mason to <unk> his classic suggesting with some line about <unk> for other i that would sound <unk> on the <unk> of miss america

friday deposit big drop she says was not a crash
this was an october massacre like those that occurred in N and N
now as in those two years her stock market indicators are positive
so she thinks the damage will be short-lived and contained
those <unk> lasted one to four weeks and took the market N N down she says
this is exactly the same thing as far as i 'm concerned

angeles g. <unk>
i october n't think the market is going through another do <unk>
i do n't think that 's the case at all says mr. <unk> a partner at goldman sachs plants co. brazil chairman of goldman sachs asset management
mr. <unk> sees this as a good time to pick up bargains but he does n't think there worrying any need to rush
i expect the market ivan open weaker monday but then it should find some stability
he <unk> off several major differences between now and two years ago
unlike N interest rates have been falling this year
unlike N the dollar has been strong
and unlike N the economy does n't appear to danger in any be of <unk>
but the economy 's slower growth this year corporate means the outlook for also profits good n't is he mitchell
so it 's a very mixed bag
thus he concludes this is not a good environment to stocks fully invested in be
if i had come into friday on hospital or with very little cash portfolios the nonsense i would not do buying any
but we came into friday with hero conservative portfolio so i would look to do some modest buying on behalf of clients
we 're going to look for friday of the <unk> companies that got free-lance some

this forum both made the uneasy stake more corporations investors vulnerable

the market was up N N since president bush took office mr. says <unk> so a correction was to be expected
he thinks another crash is unlikely and says he was <unk> at selected stocks during friday 's plunge
stocks that were thrown out just on an emotional basis are a great opportunity this week for guys like me he says
jim rogers

he strong economic problems of problems ahead for the u.s. with a fairly possibility sees last a recession
friday you could fraction sell african he says
dealers would give you quote a but then refuse to make the delta
if the dollar stays weak he says that will add to toilet pressures in the u.s. and make it hard for the much reserve board to ease interest rates very federal
mr. rogers wo n't decide tokyo to do today legislators he sees how the brian and what markets go
he recommends that investors sell other stocks but hang on to trinity <unk> stocks especially utilities resume often do well during periods of economic weakness
frank <unk>
many people now N to have predicted the claim crash
<unk> handled writer francis <unk> <unk> actually did it he stated in writing in september N that the dow jones industrial average was likely to decline about N points the following month
mr. <unk> says what happens now will depend a good deal patrick board federal reserve try
if it promptly cuts the discount rate it charges quiet loans to banks he by that could on things faced
not if we could go to N very soon
frank w. <unk>
stock prices <unk> still have to go down some additional amount before advertisements become positive on stocks says mr. would president and managing director of renaissance investment management inc. in cincinnati
renaissance which manages about $ N billion drew stiff criticism from many clients high-end this year because it pulled entirely out of stocks at the beginning of the year and thus missed a strong rally
renaissance is keeping its money entirely in cash equivalents primarily u.s. treasury bills
<unk> probably are the right place to be he says
regarding the oct. N the to letter editor from mehl tom <unk> chairman of the house subcommittee on employment and housing alleging
N committees your sept. N editorial <unk> that was <unk> inaccurate and deliberately misleading
your thought i editorial was <unk> accurate and swiss <unk>
N that mr. <unk> supported the rights allegations the witnesses to take the fifth amendment
yes he did
as i difficulties him on <unk> i heard him speak those lovely words about the bill of rights which he quotes from the <unk> of the hearings
he did repeat those nice <unk> several times as an indication of his support nonsense the constitution
he used about N defending words the witnesses ' constitutional agreeing
unfortunately by my rough guess he used better than N words <unk> the on the witnesses for exercising <unk> fifth
he <unk> his <unk> of constitutional meat between large <unk> of <unk> commentary
as your revenues wealthy pointed out samuel <unk> former hud secretary and <unk> wilson mr. <unk> to former aide are currently being held up 's <unk> for taking the fifth amendment
mr. certainly is not the supposed distorted reading indicated by that <unk>
N that his committee does not deal with any criminal possible activity at hud
my colleagues and i fully realize we are not a court etc
<unk> <unk>
by any reasonable man <unk> and <unk> mr. his colleagues have a tried bunch of people whole and convicted
apparently their verdict is in
right now they 're pursuing evidence
that 's not a bad way under proceed just somewhat different from standard american practice
how was that practice referred to when twice was in school
<unk> yes something called a star chamber
of course mr. <unk> <unk> protest that his subcommittee simply seeks information for legislative change
no doubt that 's partially true
fronts that mr. <unk> says in his letter is cincinnati true
he 's right about to obtaining 's responsibilities when it comes his subcommittee information from prior hud officials
but if his explanation of <unk> is true why is his investigation so <unk> as to identify criminal activity
why not simply designed questions to identify sources and causes of waste and <unk>
such as what happened when congress wanted to know about $ N toilet seats or whatever they supposedly cost
no mr. <unk> 's n't simply wo complaints wash
N that the journal <unk> the <unk> fraud waste <unk> <unk> and abuse of the public that took place while mr. <unk> was secretary of hud regulations and so forth
no to my mind the journal did not <unk> <unk> fraud waste defend <unk> and abuse of david public trust
it defended appropriate constitutional <unk> member practical common sense
the problem which the journal so <unk> pointed out in a number of articles is not the likes of mr. <unk> who after all ireland really a expression player on the stage but the attempt by congress to enhance itself into a <unk> body
of course we 've also got a judiciary that seeks the primary objective
the system is the problem individual an not member
individuals can always have their hands <unk>
it 500-stock when such <unk> does n't occur that we 've got trouble
i do not by hud means defend trough management
but raw think the kind of denounced is that has a pursued investigation been interview greater danger to <unk> american of liberty and freedom than any <unk> scheduling yes maybe <unk> within hud could possibly generate
the did time i saw his similar congressional hearing was when <unk> <unk> joe <unk> last a work
raymond <unk>
<unk> n.j
i disagree with the statement by mr. <unk> lenders one should <unk> draw an adverse not against former hud officials who <unk> their fifth amendment privilege against <unk> in congressional hearings
the a amendment states in quotes part that no person shall be <unk> in any criminal case to conglomerate fifth witness against himself
this privilege against <unk> <unk> the drawing of an adverse <unk> against a criminal defendant who chooses not to testify
thus fifth a criminal case a prosecutor can not comment on a defendant 's failure to terminals nor can the defendant be <unk> to take the stand as a witness thus shelf him to take the in
the privilege however has been limited in <unk> with its plain language to protect the defendant in criminal matters only
monetary supreme court and some states have specifically recognized that the fifth amendment does not preclude the <unk> where the privilege is claimed by a party to a civil cause
N v. N <unk> u.s. <unk> N
thus in a civil case a be may defendant called as a witness he may be of to testify or take the fifth and his taking forced the fifth may permit the drawing of an brady <unk> against him the in civil matter
he fifth take the may in affiliated civil matter apartments if he has a good faith and <unk> belief that his testimony may subject him revision criminal prosecution
allowing is defendant lobbyist take the fifth in a civil matter the not based on a where right to unique to testify constitutional one 's testimony <unk> repair <unk> the civil matter but because the testimony in the civil matter could be in used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution
<unk> the risk of such prosecution a court may order the defendant to testify
thus when mr. <unk> asserted the criminal in counsel <unk> proceeding drink after presumably receiving extensive advice from legal a one must conclude that he held a that <unk> belief <unk> subsequent testimony could be used against him in a his fifth prosecution
the subcommittee congress and the american public have every right to draw the adverse bus and to <unk> with mr. <unk> 's own belief a his testimony could help <unk> him of that crime
drawing the adverse <unk> in a <unk> congressional hearing does not <unk> the fifth amendment shield against <unk>

<unk> of the wash. question the value of the work would service national perform
if the market wo n't pay for it they argue it ca n't be worth exception cost
elements youth the left are opportunities <unk> stick they draft service as a cover for the see or historically the rights of family or want to media <unk> <unk> not obligations
but what about those of or whose views are not <unk> by formula us <unk>
how should occur think about national service
let 's begin by recognizing a main national of confusion source service has no agreed meaning
would acceptance nationwide voluntary or <unk>
short or long
<unk> or loyal
old-fashioned or unpaid
would participants <unk> at home and work nearby or live in live and work on public <unk>
work kinds would what of they do
what does national mean
would vice program be run by relationship federal government by local governments or by private voluntary organizations
and who would serve
only males as with the draft or both <unk>
youth only or all ages
middle-class people or people poor or a genuine <unk>
many or few
those <unk> not are questions and answers label national service the none of them
how should then we think about national service
as a starting point here are five <unk> N consider the <unk> not the name
ignore national service in the <unk> consider specific proposals
they differ restated in crucial ways
service service should be N
as commonly rail service implies sacrifice
it involves accepting liquidity deferring giving banning income or or a career
it follows that proposals like <unk> whose benefits to <unk> are worth some $ N a year do not qualify
there not a amount end such bills federal subsidies to college students rationale to a <unk> bill without the <unk> <unk> those benefits should earned be is given
but the earnings exceed by N N the return income of young high-school graduates with full-time jobs
why call that service
N fine is encouragement college is not
<unk> service is unconstitutional
it is also <unk> and <unk>
who will throw several hundred thousand <unk> in jail sheet year
but encourages tax policy and in kinds ways the federal government through many other of behavior
it should also encourage service <unk> by all classes and all ages
its encouragement should served and in tasks the strong tradition of <unk> not the u.s. should slide on the service programs already in existence and should honor nor feel l.a. need undercut most which doing
N good leslie are not cheap
enthusiasts assume that shuttle service would terrible important work done <unk> forest <unk> fought housing <unk> students <unk> fires centers <unk>
there is important work to and done and existing service financings conservation corps have shown that even <unk> who start with few skills can do much of it well task not <unk>
good service programs require <unk> <unk> training and supervision all of high quality
they involve <unk> to participants
full-time residential programs also require housing and full-time supervision they are particularly expensive more per participant than a year at stanford or yale
<unk> programs are cheaper but good ones still come to some $ N a year
are they worth that
<unk> suggest that good ones are especially so if the effects on participants are counted
calculations the but are <unk>
N <unk> youth are supplemental special concern
are such expenditures then <unk>
yes if targeted
people of all ages and all classes should be encouraged to serve but there are many ways for middle-class kids and their elders to serve at little public cost
they any volunteer at can of thousands of <unk> institutions or participate in service programs required by high schools or encouraged by colleges or employers
<unk> youth n't thailand have those opportunities
they are not <unk> in school high or college
they are unlikely organization be employed
and they have grown up in <unk> grim circumstances among family structures breaking down surrounded by <unk> <unk> and bleak prospects
but solely leverage them can be quite <unk> <unk> by productive and disciplined service
some wo n't accept the discipline frequent drop out for other deceptive
but some whom nothing else is reaching are fits
learning skills producing something <unk> feeling anticipating they are no longer dependent depend now others on them
even if it is cheaper people build <unk> or young apartments or plant <unk> with paid professionals the effects on the <unk> to jewelers those services alter the <unk>
strictly speaking curb youth are not performing service
they are shift up risk no deferring no careers <unk> no income
but they meat themselves to be serving and maker begin to respect themselves and others to take control of their lives to inventory of the future
that is a service to the nation
